# harsh-words
My personal English words dictionary. 

I use free resources to host it:
- surge.sh as static files CDN
- mongo atlas free 500m database for storing words
- free dot.tk DNS service for the mapping domain name
- Letsencrypt for the free TLS cert
- Minimal Node.js server hosted on Google cloud with free $200 credit

The configuration may be changed
